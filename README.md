# Hub by Team Enjinx
For the TransUnion Hackathon 2017, created a system for people to see their credit information more easily and be able to improve their credit score by being able to visualize their data and get recommendations for credit improvement. 
Hub provides a portal for users to see all of their credit information through a web application. By communicating with the Brain API also created by our team, we were able to get information from TransUnion to give effective graphs and charts for credit monitoring.
This web application was developed using ReactJS, Animate.CSS, and Chart.js to provide a clean and interactive application for credit visualization.
